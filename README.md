## Overview 
As a former high school teacher, a major part of my job was preparing students for university. Students were always overwhelmed by the vast and convoluted college pamphlets and brochures. This visualization if an objective view on college statistics that is meant to be easily digestible.

The project seeks to make the process of looking through universities simple and interactive. Students are able to search for universities, view statistics on gender demographics, majors and more!
